            <b>Striving for excellence</b> in this graphic design course involves creating original content, respecting copyright laws, and producing work that reflects my best effort. Understanding copyright laws will alter your approach when using visual elements. It encourages me to seek or create original content and respect the rights of creators that may need to be sourced. For me, I am not-so-artistically talented with drawing my own art. Therefore, I often use the AI generation tool in Photoshop or Adobe Firefly to help me create my own unique content. This also assists me in adhering to copyright principles and maintaining academic integrity.
<br> <br>
Graphic design often involves communication with a broader audience. Understanding the ethical use of images and respecting diverse perspectives are essential. Considering the diverse perspectives and cultural contexts of your audience is important and could involve adapting designs to be more culturally sensitive or inclusive. 
<br> <br>
<b>Ethics</b> plays an important role in software development, and this importance extends to students studying software development and graphic design. As a student aspiring to become a software developer, understanding and practicing ethical principles is an important part of my professional development.
