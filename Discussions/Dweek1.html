<p><b>Adobe Photoshop</b> is a widely recognized standard for graphic design. It offers a detailed set of tools for image editing, design, and digital painting. Photoshop is known for advanced features like layers, masks, and filters. Adobe's subscription-based model can be expensive for some users. The software's extensive features can also be overwhelming for beginners. There are new AI generation aspects added to adobe photoshop which makes photo manipulation easier.
<br> <br>
    <b>GIMP</b> is a free, open-source alternative to Photoshop. It provides a wide range of image editing tools, including layers, filters, and brushes. The user interface might not be as user-friendly as Photoshop, and it may lack some advanced features.
    <br> <br>
    <b>CorelDRAW</b> is known for vector graphics, making it a solid choice for illustrations and logos. Vector graphics are a type of computer graphic rendered by using geometric shapes and mathematical equations. It's available as a one-time purchase, which can be cost-effective in the long run. However, since It's primarily focus is on vector graphics, it may not be suitable for more robust photo editing capabilities.
    <br> <br>
    * Depending on how advanced and detailed and diverse you want your logos to be, I would say adobe photoshop is the best option. Especially with new AI generative aspects included in adobe I believe it would be worth the cost to create more intricate logos and photos.
