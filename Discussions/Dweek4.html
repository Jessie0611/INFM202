            <b>Layouts</b> play a pivotal role in design by influencing visual hierarchy, user experience, and overall aesthetics.
  Effective layouts enhance information organization, guiding the viewer's attention and facilitating a seamless understanding of content.
  <br>
   <b>Templates</b> offer a structured approach to design, providing a predefined framework that can save time and ensure consistency. They are beneficial for beginners or projects with tight deadlines.
   On the other hand, <b>free-form design </b>allows for greater creativity and flexibility, offering a more personalized and unique outcome. 
   
   <br> <br>Choosing between <b>free-form</b> and <b>template-based design</b> depends on the specific project requirements and the designer's preferences. While templates offer efficiency and consistency, free-form design allows for more artistic expression and adaptability. The thing that makes templates so popular is that they always have a nice look to them, there is no question as to where you should put your dropdown menu or where to place certain content. Templates typically have a psychological framework at the ready and because of this I personally think a hybrid of the two approaches can sometimes be best if the template has a lot of editing options to make the website more unique. However, given that I have ample time to complete a project, I would choose a free form layout over a template to create a more unique and personalized website.
   <br> <br> Using the <b>Gestalt principles</b> in design will help you create a better user experience. These principles help you consider other people’s perspective on your website through aspects such as emergence, reification, and invariance.
