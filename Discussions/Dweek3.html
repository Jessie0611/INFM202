<b>Readability</b> and <b>legibility</b> are the main points emphasized regarding font. <b>Fonts</b> should be carefully selected to match the message and tone of the design. Legible fonts enhance comprehension, while stylistic choices should be made in consideration of the target audience.

<br> <br>Our book talks about the psychological impact and cultural associations linked to different colors and <b>color theory</b>. Designers should consider emotional responses that colors can evoke and ensure harmony within the overall design. Chapter 8 discusses the importance of color contrast for readability and visual appeal. Your color choices for a design are critical in emphasizing elements and creating a cohesive visual identity. Designers need to be cautious with color choices because colors have cultural, psychological, and contextual implications. For instance, warm colors like red may convey excitement or urgency, while cool colors like blue represent calmness. The wrong color choice can lead to misinterpretation of a company. Overall, a designer should consider the intended message, target audience, and cultural context to effectively use fonts and colors in graphic design.
