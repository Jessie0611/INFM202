          <p><b>Brainstorming</b> is a creative problem-solving method for conjuring up ideas. 
            It can involve a team working together on a project or a single individual working on a solo project.
             Brainstorming encourages free thinking . Sketching is a visual method of communicating these ideas and concepts.
              It involves creating rough, informal drawings or diagrams to represent  ideas, concepts, or designs. 
             <br> <br> <b>Sketching</b> can be done on paper or digitally, and it can range from simple doodles to 
             more detailed drawings, depending on the purpose.
<br> <br>
            The choice between brainstorming and sketching depends on the specific goal and context. A combination of both methods can be more beneficial. Starting out with a brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and then use sketching to visualize and refine it. Personally, I find both methods valuable. I can be very indecisive at times so I think the combination works best for me. I also personally lack the gifted ability to create good art by hand - be it on paper or virtually -  but a rough sketch can give me the beginnings of the visualization I need to design what I want with image editing software. So overall I would argue that both are needed. Brainstorming is excellent for stimulating creative thinking, while sketching provides a tangible way to convey those ideas.
