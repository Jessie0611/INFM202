  <b>Graphic design</b> is a creative process that involves combining text and visuals to
   communicate ideas or information effectively. It encompasses a range of visual elements, including images, 
   typography, and layout, to convey a message or evoke a particular response.
  <br> <br>
  <b>Layout</b> refers to the arrangement of visual elements on a page or screen, including images, 
  text, and other design elements. It involves the organization and structuring of these elements to c
  reate a visually appealing and functional composition.
  <br> <br>
  In graphic design software, a <b>layer</b> is a separate level at which you can place and manipulate
   visual elements independently. Layers allow designers to work on different components of a design without 
   affecting the rest, providing flexibility and control over the final output.
  <br> <br>
  <b>Pixel graphics</b>, also known as raster graphics, are composed of individual pixels,
   which are tiny dots that make up an image. Each pixel has its own color, and when combined,
    they create the overall image.
  <br> <br>
  <b>Vector graphics</b> use mathematical equations to create shapes and lines, allowing for scalability
   without loss of quality. Unlike pixel graphics, vector graphics are not made up of individual pixels but
    are based on paths defined by mathematical equations.
    <br> <br><br><br>
    <b>Function of Graphic Design:</b> <br>
The primary function of graphic design is to visually communicate a message or information effectively.
 This can include conveying a brand's identity, promoting a product or service, providing information
  in a clear and engaging manner, or creating aesthetically pleasing visual experiences.
<br> <br><br><br>
<b>Four Things Good Graphic Design Does:</b>
<br>
<b>Attract Attention:</b> Good graphic design should grab the viewer's attention and create a positive first impression.
<br>
<b>Convey a Message</b>: It should effectively communicate the intended message or information.
<br>
<b>Build and Reinforce Brand Identity</b>: Graphic design plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining a consistent brand identity.
Facilitate User Action: Whether it's making a purchase, seeking more information, or any other desired action, graphic design should guide users toward taking the intended steps.
<br> <br> <br>
<b>Three Building Blocks for Graphic Design and Layout:</b>
<br>
<b>Hierarchy</b>: Establishing a clear visual hierarchy helps guide the viewer's attention and understand the importance of different elements in the design.
<br>
<b>Balance</b>: Achieving a sense of balance in the layout ensures that visual elements are distributed harmoniously, creating a visually pleasing composition.
<br>
<b>Contrast</b>: Contrast involves creating visual differences between elements to highlight important information and create interest in the design.
