    <h1>Reflection</h1></div>
    <br>
<p>
<b>Ethical Reasoning:</b> <br>
<br>
Reflect on my ability to make ethical decisions in various situations. Consider instances where I have had to weigh different values and principles. Identify ongoing efforts to enhance your ethical reasoning skills by engaging in ethical discussions, seeking guidance from teachers, and taking courses that challenge my ethical thinking.
Ethics plays an important role in software development, and this importance extends to students studying software development and graphic design. As a student aspiring to become a software developer, understanding and practicing ethical principles is an important part of my professional development.
<br><br><br>
<b>Intercultural Competence:</b> <br>
<br>
Evaluate my openness and ability to interact effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. Consider experiences that have broadened my cultural understanding.
Reflect on efforts to enhance my intercultural competence, such as participating in cultural exchange programs, learning new languages, or actively seeking diverse perspectives in my personal and professional life.
<br><br><br>
<b>Striving for excellence: </b><br>
<br>
Creating original content, respecting copyright laws, and producing work that reflects my best effort. 
Understanding the ethical use of images and respecting diverse perspectives are essential.
<br><br><br>
<b>Civic Engagement: </b><br>
<br>
Consider my commitment to civic engagement, whether through volunteering, participating in community events, or advocating for positive change. Reflect on how these activities align with your values and contribute to the greater good.
