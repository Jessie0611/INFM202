  A design brief provides essential information and guidance to designers before they begin a project. It typically ask questions such as:
  <br> <br>
  <br>--- What is the project about, and what are the goals? <br>
  <br>--- Who is the intended audience or user? <br>
  <br>--- What messages or information should the design convey? <br>
  <br>--- Are there specific brand elements or guidelines that need to be followed? <br>
  <br>--- What are the budget constraints and project deadlines? <br>
  <br>--- Are there any specific items or designs requested? <br>
<br> <br> 
<b>Brainstorming Technique: Mind Mapping</b> <br> <br>
<br>Mind mapping is a brainstorming technique that involves creating a visual representation of ideas and their relationships. It starts with a central concept or theme, and branches out into related subtopics or ideas. It's a useful tool to generate and organize ideas in a non-linear fashion, encouraging creative thinking and exploration of various possibilities.
