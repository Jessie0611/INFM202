<p><b>Design Brief Questions:</b> <br>
  A design brief is a document that provides essential information and guidance to designers before they begin a project. It typically answers questions such as:
  <br>
  <br>Project Overview: What is the project about, and what are the goals?
  <br>Target Audience: Who is the intended audience or user?
  <br>Key Messages: What messages or information should the design convey?
  <br>Brand Guidelines: Are there specific brand elements or guidelines that need to be followed?
  <br>Budget and Timeline: What are the budget constraints and project deadlines?
  <br>Deliverables: What specific items or designs need to be produced?
<br> <br>
<b>Brainstorming Technique: Mind Mapping</b>
<br>Mind mapping is a brainstorming technique that involves creating a visual representation of ideas and their relationships. It starts with a central concept or theme, and branches out into related subtopics or ideas. It's a useful tool to generate and organize ideas in a non-linear fashion, encouraging creative thinking and exploration of various possibilities.
